## Abstract :

Step back in time to the chilling era of the Salem Witch Trials in this immersive and historically inspired video game. "Witch Hunt: Unraveling Salem's Secrets" invites players to experience the hysteria, suspicion, and moral dilemmas of 17th-century New England. As a resident of Salem Village, you must navigate a complex web of accusations, deception, and fear while uncovering the true nature of the witchcraft hysteria. Will you protect your neighbors, or will you succumb to paranoia and superstition? With stunning visuals, a haunting soundtrack, and morally challenging decisions, this game offers a thought-provoking and suspenseful journey into one of history's darkest chapters. Can you survive the trials and tribulations of Salem, or will you become a victim of the witch hunt?
